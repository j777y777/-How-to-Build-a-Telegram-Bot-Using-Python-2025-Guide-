🧪 Example: Your First Telegram Bot

Here's a simple echo bot:

from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import ApplicationBuilder, CommandHandler, MessageHandler, filters, ContextTypes

async def start(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await update.message.reply_text("Hey! I'm your bot 🤖")

async def echo(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await update.message.reply_text(update.message.text)

app = ApplicationBuilder().token("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN").build()
app.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
app.add_handler(MessageHandler(filters.TEXT & ~filters.COMMAND, echo))

app.run_polling()

    🧠 Pro tip: Replace "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" with your BotFather token.
